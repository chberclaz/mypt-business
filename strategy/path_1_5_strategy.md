# Path 1.5 Strategy — Boutique at Meaningful Scale

## Chosen path

**Path 1.5**:  
A small, calm, high-ticket, enterprise-focused business targeting ~CHF 0.5M ARR.

This sits between:

- Path 1 (pure boutique consulting)
- Path 2 (small productized platform)

## Why not stay very small (Path 1)?

- Switzerland has a high cost of living
- Long-term financial stability requires meaningful recurring revenue
- CHF ~150k ARR caps optionality and increases stress

## Why not venture-scale (Path 3)?

- High operational complexity
- Loss of autonomy
- Reduced time for engineering
- Misalignment with personal values

## Target scale

- 10–15 customers total
- CHF 30k–60k ARR per customer
- Strong long-term contracts
- Low churn
- High trust

## Expected outcome

- CHF ~0.5M ARR
- Predictable income
- Bankable financial profile
- Calm operational tempo

## Operating principles

- Say no to bad-fit customers
- Prefer depth over breadth
- Optimize for long-term trust
- Keep infrastructure simple
- Avoid unnecessary growth
