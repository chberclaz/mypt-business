# Risk Analysis & SWOT

This document captures the main strategic risks of the MyPT business and how they are mitigated.
It exists to avoid blind spots and repeated re-evaluation.

---

## Strengths

- Deep technical ownership of the full system (model, RAG, agent loop, tooling)
- Fully local / offline architecture with strong differentiation
- Clear niche positioning (privacy, control, on-prem AI)
- High trust potential with enterprise customers
- Low direct competition in the specific “agentic on-prem AI system” space
- Low operational complexity compared to cloud-based offerings

---

## Weaknesses

- Solo founder capacity limits:
  - sales bandwidth
  - support bandwidth
  - availability risk
- Limited marketing reach compared to large vendors
- High reliance on personal expertise for deployments
- Slower feature velocity compared to large teams

---

## Opportunities

- Increasing regulatory pressure against cloud AI usage
- Internal bans or restrictions on ChatGPT / cloud LLMs
- Growing interest in on-prem and air-gapped AI deployments
- Rising cost and sustainability concerns around hyperscale AI
- Enterprises seeking predictable, controllable AI systems
- Strong demand for AI systems that integrate with existing internal workflows

---

## Threats

- Large vendors moving into on-prem AI offerings
- Rapid evolution of foundation models
- Customer procurement cycles being slow or complex
- Scope creep from customers requesting excessive customization
- Over-dependence on a small number of large customers

---

## Mitigation Strategies

- Keep customer count intentionally low (10–15 max)
- Maintain standardized deployment patterns
- Clearly define supported features and boundaries
- Prefer long-term contracts over ad-hoc work
- Document decisions and non-goals explicitly
- Say no to bad-fit customers and projects

## Strategic Conclusion

The main risk to MyPT is not technical feasibility, but **overextension**.
The primary mitigation is disciplined scope control and intentional business scale.
