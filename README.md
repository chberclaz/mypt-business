# MyPT — Business & Strategy Notes

This repository contains the **business, product, and strategic reasoning** behind the MyPT project.

It is intentionally separate from the main code repository.

## Purpose

- Capture long-term decisions and reasoning
- Avoid rethinking the same questions repeatedly
- Document positioning, pricing, and go-to-market strategy
- Serve as a reference for future partners, customers, or banks
- Reduce cognitive load and decision fatigue

## Scope

This repository covers:

- Vision and long-term goals
- Product positioning and value proposition
- Pricing and revenue strategy
- Go-to-market and customer acquisition
- Strategic decisions and trade-offs
- Sustainability / “green AI” positioning

This is **not marketing copy**.
This repository is the single source of truth for all non-code decisions related to MyPT.

## Guiding principle

> Build a calm, sustainable, high-quality business  
> without sacrificing technical depth or personal well-being.
