# Executive Summary

## Overview

MyPT is a fully local, offline, agentic AI platform designed for organizations that need GPT-like capabilities without sending data to the cloud.

It runs entirely on customer-controlled infrastructure and combines:

- local language models
- retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- agentic tool-based reasoning

MyPT enables enterprises to use AI on sensitive internal knowledge while maintaining full data ownership, auditability, and operational control.

## Problem

Many organizations want to adopt AI but cannot:

- send proprietary or regulated data to cloud-based LLM providers
- accept vendor lock-in or opaque data handling
- satisfy compliance and audit requirements with external APIs
- justify hyperscale infrastructure costs and energy consumption

As a result, AI adoption is either blocked or handled through expensive, fragile internal projects.

## Solution

MyPT provides:

- an on-prem, offline AI assistant
- document-grounded reasoning via RAG
- agentic workflows using explicit tool calls
- predictable, controllable system behavior

All data remains inside the customer’s environment.

## Business Model

- Annual enterprise license (CHF 30k–60k)
- One-time deployment and setup fee
- Optional customization, fine-tuning, and integration services

## Strategic Goal

Operate as a calm, sustainable, solo-founder business with:

- 10–15 long-term enterprise customers
- ~CHF 0.5M recurring annual revenue
- low churn and high trust
