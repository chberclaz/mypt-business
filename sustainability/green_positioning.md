# Sustainability & Green Positioning

## Core idea

MyPT is a **compute-efficient, low-footprint AI system** designed to avoid hyperscale infrastructure.

## Why this matters

- Large cloud LLMs require massive data centers
- Continuous inference has high energy cost
- Enterprises increasingly track ESG metrics

## Sustainable characteristics

- Smaller models (~750M parameters)
- Runs on existing or older hardware
- No hyperscaler dependency
- Local inference reduces network and idle GPU overhead
- RAG + tools reduce unnecessary token generation

## Positioning language

Preferred:

- “Compute-efficient AI”
- “Low-footprint on-prem AI”
- “Sustainable enterprise AI deployment”

Avoid:

- “Carbon neutral”
- “Zero emissions”
- Absolute environmental claims
