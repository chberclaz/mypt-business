# Value Proposition

## Core statement

MyPT is a **fully local, offline, agentic AI platform** that allows organizations to use GPT-like capabilities on their own infrastructure — safely, privately, and under full control.

## The real problem we solve

Organizations want AI assistance on internal data but cannot:

- send documents to cloud LLMs
- accept compliance or privacy risks
- depend on vendor-controlled APIs

## What MyPT provides

- On-prem, offline AI assistant
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over internal documents
- Agentic reasoning via toolcalling
- Workspace-based document understanding
- Full data ownership and auditability

## Why pretrained models alone are not enough

Pretrained models are:

- engines, not systems
- stateless
- unaware of internal knowledge
- not auditable
- not integrated into workflows

MyPT is a **complete system**, not just a model.

## Key differentiators

- Fully local execution
- Agentic tool-based reasoning
- Workspace abstraction
- Trainable and extensible
- No vendor lock-in
