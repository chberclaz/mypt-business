# Operations Plan

## Delivery Model

MyPT is delivered as an on-premise software system installed and operated entirely within the customer’s infrastructure.

There is no managed cloud service component.

## Typical Deployment Flow

1. Initial requirements and infrastructure discussion
2. Validation of hardware and OS environment
3. Secure installation under dedicated system user
4. Document ingestion and RAG index creation
5. Model configuration and validation
6. User onboarding and basic training
7. Production go-live

## Ongoing Operations

- Periodic software updates
- Support via agreed communication channels
- Optional re-indexing or fine-tuning as data evolves

## Support Model

- Standard support included with license
- Clear scope and response expectations
- No 24/7 emergency support unless explicitly contracted

## Scalability Philosophy

- Low customer volume
- Standardized deployments
- High reliability
- Avoid operational overload to preserve founder sustainability
